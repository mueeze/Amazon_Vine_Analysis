## Overview
> The purpose was to Extract data from an amazon dataset transform it and load it to local database in PG Admin. I chose the automotive dataset.

## Summary
> In conclusion we can rely on the reviews and not worry about bias when making decisions. This can be applied in star ratings as well and to understand negative reviews to diminish goodwill/unfair competition.
